/*explicit and implicit, explicit grid is always the part you define with grid template columns and rows and sometimes, you define entire grid like in our project where you define header, main, footer, that 
was everything we have on the page, but sometimes you only define parts of the grid or nothing at all and the parts you didnot define explictly are then managed with the implicit grid which you can
in turn control with the grid-auto settings*/
