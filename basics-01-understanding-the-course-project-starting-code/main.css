    class will overwrite the tag element in any order.
    order matters only when applying the same tag
    
    {{for the same tag or same level of specificiaty, the one write at the bottom will overwrite the one writen on top}}

    inline style have the highest priority
    then is class.

    (The priority can be seen in the developer tool, listed in order, top one has highest priority(which is inline style))

    <tag> selector has lowest priority,
    then would be class
    then would be ID selector
    highest would be inline style
