1.
    Adjacent Sibling:
    h2 + p {
        color: red;         
    }

    the adjacent sibling selector simply is defined like this.
    Here we set a red color
    it assigns it to all paragraphs that directly follow a h2 tag, which is why the first and last paragraph gets the red color
    {{and the second one does not because the second one follows a h3 tag which is in between a h2 tag adnd the paragraph therefore is not a direct sibling of the h2 tag.
    The plus sign requires a direct sibiling}}

    1)Elements have to share the same parent
    2)The second element comes immediately after first element

2.
    General Sibling
    h2 ~ p{
        color:red;
    }

    all paragraphs get red color, even though the second one doesn't directly follow a h2 tag.
    {{ for the General sibling, it's only important that there is a h2 sibiling, does not have to be directly in front of it, just a h2 element on the same level as the paragraph in this case}}

    1)Have to have the same parent
    2)the second elements comes after the first one but does not have to come directly after it

3.
    Child combinator
    div > p{
        color: red;
    }

    this child combinator says any paragraph that is direct child of a div should get the style.

4.
    desendant combinator
    div p {
        color:red;
    }
    here it only matters there is a div somewhere above p in the DOM
    does not have to be direct parent
